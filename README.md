# Section 39: Natural Language Processing

A practice notebook to discuss different ways to prepare text/language data for machine learning. Contains plenty of resources to act as a jumping off point for anyone interested in working with text/language data.

Learning Objectives:

- Define what types of data are considered "natural language" data
- Discuss the pros and cons of some pre-processing steps often used with natural language data (removing stopwords, for example)
- Extract features suitable for machine learning from text data
- Use a supervised classifier to classify texts after appropriate pre-processing

Prepared for the DS-PT-030220 Cohort, with <3 by Lindsey Berlin
